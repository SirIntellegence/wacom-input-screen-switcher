# My project's README
A python program to change what screen your tablet is mapped to. Usually invoked by a button on the tablet.
Linux is currently the only OS supported.
You will need to install screeninfo with pip for it to work. I currently do not have an automated install script for that. You will need to install it for python3 since that is what this code uses

```
#!bash

pip install screeninfo
```
